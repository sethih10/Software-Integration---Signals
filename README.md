Assignment 1 (Task 3)


Assignment1.py  is the main script to run the audio player which has capability equivalent to Shazam as well as print the major frequency in the plot and it's value and the tone. It is fairly easy to use.

The button includes - 


Load Wav file
Stop, Resume - This work for both the recordings as well as loaded files 
Reset - It clears the plots and gives the option to again choosing loading file or starting recording
Start Recording 
Save Recording 
Compare loaded file/last recording - It tells the name of the file played from the database by using fft similar to shazam (please see the matching_sounds.py) script. On clicking this button, it tells the name of the song played by the last loaded file or the sound heard in the microphone if you use the option of recording.
